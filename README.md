# Hack Assembler

This is an assembler made as the final assignment for the [Nand To Tetris Course: Part 1](https://nand2tetris.org/project06). It assumes that the assembly file does not have errors for now.

To run this against hack assembly files clone this repo and run the following command with the path of the file:
```
cargo run <path>
```
The file will be written next to the source file.
